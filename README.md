# html-begin
my beginnings with html because apparently you need it with javascript and css to make a dumbass website or webapp so stupid why do you need to learn three fucking languages


website redirect didn't work so possible issue is that i need something locally for it to refer to, or that the program itself cannot redirect to the website because i didn't launch a website - honestly i don't know but eventually ill find out when i'm creating more shit
